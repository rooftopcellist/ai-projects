This is a collection of Artificial Intelligence Algorithms.  Currently, there is a core implementation of a Markov Model, a backpropagating Neural Network, a k-means clustering classifier, k-Nearest Neighbor and Bayesian Classification.  
* Bayes still needs to be implemented fully and applied to a dataset
* Test cases need to be written for each of these algorithms.  
* Each algorithm should be revised to make them easy to apply to new scenarios.


> Note: This is meant to become a useful starting point when approaching new big data problems.
